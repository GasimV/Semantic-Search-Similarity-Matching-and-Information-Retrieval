## Project Overview:

- The Azerbaijani Legal Acts Search Engine (ALASE) leverages state-of-the-art NLP techniques to provide users with an intuitive interface to search and retrieve pertinent legal acts from the extensive Azerbaijani legislation corpus. Utilizing a distilled version of BERT, known as DistilBERT, for encoding both the corpus and user queries, ALASE offers unparalleled accuracy and speed in returning search results that are semantically aligned with user intent.

## Technical Summary:

- This project implements a semantic search pipeline that includes:

    - An encoder based on DistilBERT to convert natural language queries and documents into dense vector representations.
    - A similarity search mechanism powered by Faiss to efficiently index and query the vectorized representations.
    - A user-friendly interface that connects the underlying AI model to a front-end application, enabling seamless user interactions.

## Key Features:

    - Bidirectional Contextual Understanding: By employing a transformer-based model like DistilBERT, ALASE understands the context of words in both directions, enhancing the accuracy of search results.
    - Scalable and Efficient Search: With Faiss integration, the system is designed to handle large-scale datasets without compromising on response times.
    - User-Focused Design: The interface is built with a focus on ease of use, allowing users to input queries in everyday language and receive relevant legal documents.

## Use Cases:

    - Legal professionals searching for specific statutes or precedents.
    - Researchers conducting legal studies.
    - Citizens seeking to understand their legal rights and obligations.

## Future Scope:

    - Implementing multilingual support to cater to a broader user base.
    - Continuous model training to incorporate the latest legal documents and amendments.
    - Expanding the database to include case law and legal commentary for comprehensive legal research.
